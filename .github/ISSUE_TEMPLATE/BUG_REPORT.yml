      description: |
        Full debug output can be obtained by running MiMiC with UART or by setting the environment variable `MIMIC_LOG=trace`.
        Please create a GitHub Gist containing the debug output. Please do _not_ paste the debug output in the issue, since debug output is long.
        Share a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log` file.
